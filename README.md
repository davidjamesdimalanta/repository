# uoftbookings

This Project uses TailwindCSS and ReactJS to create an updated version of the
recreation.utoronto.ca bookings webpage. 

The focus of this app was to improve upon already existing webpages by using 
industry standard frameworks.

In this web app, I identified the following issues with the current 
webpage:
 
- Navbar spacing of content is awkward
- Navbar overlaps with header thus header text is slightly hidden
- No search bar
- Cards for each court only take up 1 column, not using the full width of the screen, 
  and making it hard to search for court 
- All sport and rec images on each card
- Cards donâ€™t have outlines

Solutions: 
- Fix navbar
- Fix heading spacing
- Add a search bar for court search 
- Make cards take up multiple columns // maybe fix card sizes
- Add images to specify sport (still WIP)
- Give cards styling and borders.
